# WebDashboard
A dashboard for monitoring network activities and controlling torrent client remotely

![alt tag](http://i.imgur.com/a1KFSR8.png)


* Each section in the dashboard is just a unscrollable iframe set at a certain position.

*  Each iframe directs my Router Web UI and Torrent Client Web UI

* Made for 1080p displays, doesn't look as good on smaller resolutions. 

* Hosted using a super-light web server called Mongoose
